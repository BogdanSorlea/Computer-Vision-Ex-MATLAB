2.Q16
3.Q2
5.Q1.7 - lines with Hough image coordinate on the edges fail to be plotted by the provided method - and have been filtered out.
5.Q2.5-6 - do more experimenting
6.Q4 - do it only after improving 6.Q1-2 (if there is time)
7.Q(1)3-5 - fix bugs that give wrong output (most likely some error in computing the homography) :(
8.Q5 - implement it
9p2.11-15 - probably computed the error in a suboptimal way
